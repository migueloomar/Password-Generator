Password Strength Evaluation Module
----------------------------------

This module provides comprehensive password strength analysis using Dropbox's
zxcvbn algorithm, which offers more realistic strength estimation than
traditional complexity rules by analyzing multiple vulnerability factors.

Key Features:
-----------------------------
- Realistic strength estimation based on:
  * Common patterns and sequences
  * Dictionary words (multiple languages)
  * Keyboard patterns (qwerty, etc.)
  * Date/number sequences
  * Contextual analysis (against user inputs)
  
- Detailed feedback system:
  * Warning messages for specific vulnerabilities
  * Suggestions for improvement
  * Estimated crack time

- Scoring System (0-4 scale):
  0: Very weak (instant compromise)
  1: Weak (seconds to minutes)
  2: Moderate (hours to days)
  3: Strong (months to years)
  4: Very strong (centuries+)

Technical Implementation:
-----------------------------
- Uses zxcvbn algorithm (Dropbox's open-source library)
- Analyzes over 30,000 common passwords
- Checks against 20+ language dictionaries
- Tests 100+ common keyboard patterns
- Calculates actual entropy bits

API Reference:
-----------------------------
check_strength(password: str) -> tuple(score: int, feedback: dict)
    - Args:
        password: The password string to evaluate
    - Returns:
        score: Integer 0-4 strength rating
        feedback: Dictionary containing:
          * warning: Specific vulnerability warnings
          * suggestions: Improvement recommendations
          * crack_time: Estimated cracking time
          * crack_time_display: Human-readable time
          * score: Duplicate of returned score

Security Considerations:
-----------------------------
1. Advantages over traditional methods:
   - Resistant to "complex but weak" passwords
   - Accounts for real-world attack patterns
   - Provides actionable feedback

2. Limitations:
   - Doesn't check password breaches by default
   - No context about the system being protected
   - English-centric suggestions

Example Usage:
-----------------------------
score, feedback = check_strength("password123")

# Output might be:
score = 1  # Weak
feedback = {
    'warning': 'This is a top 10 common password',
    'suggestions': [
        'Add another word or two',
        'Avoid common words'
    ],
    'crack_time': 0.0015,
    'crack_time_display': 'instant'
}

Dependencies:
- zxcvbn >= 4.4.28
- Python >= 3.6

    """
    Evaluate password strength using advanced pattern matching and entropy analysis.
    
    Args:
        password (str): The password string to evaluate. Both ASCII and Unicode supported.
        
    Returns:
        tuple: (score, feedback) where:
            score (int): Strength rating 0-4
            feedback (dict): Detailed analysis including:
                - warning (str): Specific vulnerability
                - suggestions (list): Improvement tips
                - crack_time (float): Seconds to crack
                - crack_time_display (str): Human-readable estimate
                - score (int): Duplicate of returned score
                
    Security Notes:
    - Handles passwords up to 128 characters
    - Returns score 0 for empty string
    - Unicode-aware analysis
    - No network calls or external lookups
    
    Performance:
    - Typically executes in 1-10ms per password
    - Memory usage scales with password length
